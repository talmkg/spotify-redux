## Spotify built on React.js + Redux & Bootstrap 5.
I've started this project to prove my React+Redux skills. This [project](https://github.com/talmkg/Spotify-Clone-DeezerAPI) originally started as collaboration with Kajal L. and Agatha O. <br/>

Artist/Album page was not transferred to this version as soon as it's useless re-writing of the code which is already perfectly working [here](https://github.com/talmkg/Spotify-Clone-DeezerAPI). <br/> Love <3
